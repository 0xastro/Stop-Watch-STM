# Stop-Watch-STM
The Project is developed using State-flow and Simulink to make pseudo concurrent tasks [Tracking the time, Switching between a set of operations/modes and checking the alarm either expired or not]. The final state machine model is auto generated into C code compatible with Discovery board, managed by ERICA OS.
